# Collection of Java projects - WIP

This repository contains modified versions of some of the Java projects that I made for the Computer Programming program at Algonquin College.

The program had four Java courses in total, so the projects I did range from basic to advanced. The first course had very basic projects while the last course had complex projects where a good amount of the source code was provided by the teacher. My goal is to add some of the projects with a good level of complexity and with most of the code belonging to me.
