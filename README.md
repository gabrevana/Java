# Java
Collection of Java projects - WIP

This repository contains modified versions of some of the Java projects that I made for the Computer Programming program at Algonquin College.

I will avoid pushing basic projects from the beginning of the program and complex projects where the teacher provided the majority of the source code. 
I will try to select projects where the majority of the code was done by me with a good level of complexity.
